# MCL - Monte Carlo Localization
MCL is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in 2D.
It implements the Monte Carlo localization approach (as described by Dieter Fox), which uses a particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.

## Benchmarking

See also [BENCHMARK.md](./BENCHMARK.md) for a guide on how to compare different settings or localization algorithms.
